The object of study is heteroscedastic observations. The purpose of the work is to develop methods for constructing $D$-optimal experimental designs for heteroscedastic observations.

Research methods -- methods of probability theory, mathematical
statistics, the theory of optimal experiment.

The results are the constructed $D$-optimal plans for heteroscedastic observations with 2 and 3 independent variables, with a linear change.

The scope is the planning of scientific and industrial experiments.
